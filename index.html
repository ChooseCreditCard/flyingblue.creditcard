    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Joint Airline Loyalty Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A joint airline loyalty card is linked to a shared frequent-flyer program used by multiple carriers. Instead of earning generic points, every purchase adds miles to a central loyalty balance that can be spent across partner airlines and routes.</p>
      <p>Because several airlines participate, you often get more routing options, more chances to find award space, and the ability to mix and match airlines on a single redemption — as long as you understand the program rules.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How You Earn Miles Across Partner Airlines</h2>
      <p>Everyday card spending earns a base rate of miles, while flights on participating airlines usually earn at higher rates. Some cards boost earnings on travel, dining or specific partner brands, making it easier to build balances if you already fly within the network.</p>
      <p>In many programs, you also earn qualifying credits or “XP” toward status tiers. Higher tiers can unlock priority services, extra baggage, better award availability and mileage bonuses on each flight.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles on Multiple Carriers</h2>
      <p>Joint programs typically let you redeem miles for flights on any participating airline, sometimes with different award charts or zones. You might combine segments from two or more carriers on a single ticket, using miles for long-haul legs while paying cash for short hops.</p>
      <p>Redemption value depends on route, cabin, season and inventory. Premium-cabin and long-haul redemptions often provide the best return per mile, while short, off-peak flights may offer only modest value once taxes and surcharges are included.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Surcharges & Availability</h2>
      <p>Even when you pay with miles, you may still owe taxes, airport fees and carrier-imposed surcharges. These can vary widely by route and operating airline, so always compare the total cash cost of a miles booking with the price of buying a ticket outright.</p>
      <p>Award availability is another key factor. Some routes release very few premium seats for miles, while others have reliable off-peak availability. Frequent travelers track patterns and book far in advance to secure the best itineraries.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who Benefits Most From Joint Airline Loyalty Cards?</h2>
      <p>These cards are suited to travelers who regularly fly within the same alliance or family of airlines, especially across Europe and long-haul international routes. If your travel is spread evenly across multiple carriers in that network, a shared-program card can consolidate value effectively.</p>
      <p>If you travel only occasionally, or mainly with low-cost carriers outside the network, a flexible travel-rewards or cashback card may deliver more predictable value than a miles-only setup.</p>
